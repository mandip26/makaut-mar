# makaut-mar

There are two python files in this repository as the coding solutions for the MAKAUT's Special activities of Mandatory Additional Requirements (MAR).

Two problems I chose were finding a number to be prime or not and finding the smallest and largest among three numbers.

The program with file name 'primeNumbers.py' inputs an int value to check if it is a prime number or not and prints the output accordingly.

The program with file name 'smallestLargest.py' inputs three (3) int values to evalueate the smallest and the largest among them and print the output accordingly.
